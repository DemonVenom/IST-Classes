### IST CLASSES #
---------------------

**HCDD440 - Human-Centered Design and Development Capstone Course**

[YumFood](https://github.com/DemonVenom/YumFood) - Dynamic Android mobile application project for HCDD440. Search for and save all of your favorite recipes! Improved and reimagined version of RecipEats. Created utilizing the Spoonacular API.


**HCDD340 - Human-Centered Design for Mobile Computing**

[RecipEats](https://github.com/DemonVenom/RecipEats) - Static Android mobile application project for HCDD340. Search for and save all of your favorite recipes! 


**IST402 - Emerging Issues and Technologies**

[WeebAPIs](https://github.com/DemonVenom/WeebAPIs) - Personal Project made for IST402 to demonstrate using APIs within a website 


**IST210 - Organization of Data**

[RandomSQL](https://github.com/DemonVenom/RandomSQL) - Assortments of SQL files created during IST210 to used create, edit, and delete databases 


**IST140 - Introduction to Application Programming**

I will eventually sort each project into their own respective repository, but for now, they will remain in the ist140-projects repository.
Many of these are simple assignments and may not require their own repository.


**IST242 - Intermediate & Object-Oriented Application Development**

As a way of tracking all of the projects, their quality, and mistakes I might have made, I have included the grade and comments recieved on each project.
Explanations for each project are placed in each repository README file. 
"Assignments" are typically easier and less demanding than "Exercises" and the final group project integrates many of the lessons learned throughout the course.
